This project will devise a system where a central authority (e.g., the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) is tasked with keeping track of the vaccination drive taking place across the US.
The collected information is useful to monitor areas of the country that are making progress vs. others that are not, adjust policies accordingly, and keep the public informed about the vaccination progress 
(e.g., by publishing daily numbers in major newspapers).
